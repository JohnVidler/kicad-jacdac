Kicad board template, footprints and symbols for the [Microsoft Jacdac project](https://aka.ms/jacdac).

20x20mm board outline template with two Jacdac connectors.

This project was originally created with the Kicad nightly development build version of KiCad v6.99 for good reasons that I won't bore you with. However, even KiCad state not to use the nightly-build for production work.

I backported the footprints and board to Kicad stable v6.07. Future development will only be with the
stable version of KiCad. Once I get rid of all the spurious error messages on the PCB design rule check for the stable build, I'll remove the nightly build folder. Nightly build can open a stable build but not the other way around.

The board design conforms with drawing 'JacdacEc30Template20x20 80-1.0 drawing.PDF'.

The Jacdac edge connector conforms with drawing 'JacdacEdgeConnectorRef 101-1.1 drawing.PDF'.

The Jacdac edge connectors have successfully been manufactured by JLCPCB.
